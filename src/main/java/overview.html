DoubleCheck, the action confirmation plugin.
</p>
<p>
There are many commands and actions that should be confirmed before the 
execution, for example a world deletion command, a money transfer, a 
ban command, or when a player is about to enter a PvP world.
</p>
<p>
Every plugin has it's own command for this. The results are 
long command names and name conflicts.
</p>
<p>
DoubleCheck solves the problem with a unified action 
confirmation service. Plugins can easily use this service 
to send confirmation requests like this:
</p>
<pre><code>
Are you sure that you want to send 2.000.000.000$ to Notch?
Please /confirm or /deny this action.
</code></pre>
<p>
To create a custom request, a class that extends the 
{@link com.github.boformer.doublecheck.api.Request Request} interface is required.
</p>
<p>
<p>It is recommended to extend the 
{@link com.github.boformer.doublecheck.api.AbstractRequest AbstractRequest} 
class which implements the interface and provides some basic features:</b></b>
</p>
<pre><code>
package example.request;

import org.spongepowered.api.entity.player.Player;
import org.spongepowered.api.text.message.Message;
import org.spongepowered.api.text.message.Messages;
import com.github.boformer.doublecheck.api.AbstractRequest;

public class TeleportRequest extends AbstractRequest
{
	private final Player fromPlayer;
	private final Player toPlayer;
	
	public TeleportRequest(Player fromPlayer, Player toPlayer, int expirationTime) 
	{
		super(toPlayer, expirationTime);
		
		this.fromPlayer = fromPlayer;
		this.toPlayer = toPlayer;
	}

	&#064;Override
	public Message[] getMessages() 
	{
		return new Message[] {Messages.of(fromPlayer.getName() + " requested a teleport to you.")};
	}

	&#064;Override
	public void confirm() 
	{
		fromPlayer.sendMessage("Teleporting...");
		fromPlayer.setLocation(toPlayer.getLocation());
	}

	&#064;Override
	public void deny() 
	{
		fromPlayer.sendMessage("Teleport request denied by " + toPlayer.getName() + "!");
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Plugins can send requests using the 
{@link com.github.boformer.doublecheck.api.ConfirmationService ConfirmationService}. 
The service can be obtained from the Sponge {@code ServiceManager}:
</p>
<pre><code>
ConfirmationService service = game.getServiceManager().provide(ConfirmationService.class).orNull();

Request myRequest = new TeleportRequest(fromPlayer, toPlayer, 30 /*seconds*/)
    
if(service != null) service.send(myRequest);
else myRequest.confirm(); //just skips confirmation if DoubleCheck not installed
</code></pre>
<p><b>
Warning: There is no guarantee that DoubleCheck is installed on a 
server and the confirmation service is provided! 
</b></p>
<p>
In case that the service can not be obtained, it is recommended to 
bypass the confirmation (see example above) or disable certain features. 
</p>
<p>
To make sure that DoubleCheck registers the service before another plugin tries 
to obtain it, it should be declared as a soft dependency:
</p>
<pre><code>
&#064;Plugin(id = "MyPlugin", name = "MyPlugin", dependencies = "after:DoubleCheck")
</code></pre>

<p>DoubleCheck, the action confirmation library for Sponge.</p>

<p>
There are many commands and actions that should be confirmed before the 
execution, for example a world deletion command, a money transfer, a 
ban command, or when a player is about to enter a PvP world.
</p>
<p>
Every plugin has it's own command for this. The results are 
long command names and name conflicts. It is also a lot of work to write the code for the confirmation command.
</p>
<p>
DoubleCheck solves the problem: The DoubleCheck confirmation service listens for the command, but does not block it permanently for other plugins or other instances of DoubleCheck.
</p>
<p>
This is a typical request that was sent using DoubleCheck:
<pre><code>
Are you sure that you want to send 2.000.000.000$ to Notch?
You have 15 seconds to /confirm or /deny the action.
</code></pre>
<p>
To create a custom request, a class that extends the 
{@link com.github.boformer.doublecheck.Request Request} interface is required.
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>
package example.request;

import org.spongepowered.api.entity.player.Player;
import org.spongepowered.api.text.Text;
import org.spongepowered.api.text.Texts;
import org.spongepowered.api.util.command.CommandSource;

import com.github.boformer.doublecheck.Request;

public class TeleportRequest implements Request
{
	private final Player fromPlayer;
	
	public TeleportRequest(Player fromPlayer) 
	{
		this.fromPlayer = fromPlayer;
	}

	&#064;Override
	public Text getMessage() 
	{
		return Texts.of(fromPlayer.getName() + " requested a teleport to you.");
	}

	&#064;Override
	public void confirm(CommandSource recipient) 
	{
		recipient.sendMessage( Texts.of("You confirmed the teleport request") );
		
		fromPlayer.sendMessage( Texts.of("Teleporting...") );
		fromPlayer.setLocation( ((Player) recipient).getLocation() );
	}

	&#064;Override
	public void deny(CommandSource recipient) 
	{
		recipient.sendMessage( Texts.of("You denied the teleport request") );
		
		fromPlayer.sendMessage( Texts.of("Teleport request denied by " + recipient.getName() + "!") );
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
To send a request, the plugin has to initialize a new instance of the {@link com.github.boformer.doublecheck.ConfirmationService ConfirmationService}:
</p>
<pre><code>
ConfirmationService service = DoubleCheck.initializeService(game, plugin);

Request myRequest = new TeleportRequest(notchPlayer, jebPlayer)
    
service.send(jebPlayer, myRequest);
</code></pre>
<p>
This will send the following request to Jeb:
</p>
<pre><code>
Notch requested a teleport to you.
You have 15 seconds to /confirm or /deny the action.
</code></pre>
